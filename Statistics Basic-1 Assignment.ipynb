For example, you cannot compute a mean for nominal data, but you can for interval and ratio data. Using the wrong type of analysis can lead to incorrect conclusions. For instance, calculating the average satisfaction level (ordinal data) might be misleading without proper statistical methods, while you can calculate an average for interval or ratio data."
